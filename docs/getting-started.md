### **AI Response Examples**
**Question**: "What's special about Usain Bolt's start?"

**AI Response**: 
> "Bolt's starting position shows several key advantages:
> 
> 1. **Hip Angle**: 42° hip flexion provides optimal power transfer
> 2. **Foot Placement**: 0.68m between blocks maximizes stride length
> 3. **Arm Position**: Creates 15% more forward momentum than average
> 
> The unique aspect is his delayed hip extension, which stores elastic energy for 0.12 seconds longer than competitors, resulting in 8% more power in his first three steps."
