# Posture Analysis Solver for Knowledge Distillation

This module implements a production-ready solver-based knowledge distillation approach for creating a domain-expert LLM specialized in posture analysis.

## Overview

Traditional knowledge distillation approaches involve querying a commercial LLM and saving query-answer pairs. However, for specialized domains requiring precise numerical processing or complex feature analysis (like posture analysis), commercial LLMs have limitations:

1. They lack direct access to specialized mathematical models
2. They cannot process complex input data like posture keypoints
3. They cannot perform detailed biomechanical analysis

This solver-based approach addresses these limitations by:

1. Creating a specialized mathematical solver for posture analysis
2. Using the solver to process raw posture data and generate detailed solutions
3. Having commercial LLMs interpret the solver's output into human-readable explanations
4. Using the resulting query-solution-explanation trios for knowledge distillation

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

### 1. Posture Models

Specialized models for analyzing different aspects of posture:
- `SpineAlignmentModel`: Analyzes spine curvature and alignment issues
- `ShoulderBalanceModel`: Assesses shoulder balance and symmetry

Each model implements:
- Input validation
- Feature processing
- Specialized analysis algorithms
- Confidence assessment

### 2. Posture Analysis Solver

The core solver that:
- Loads appropriate models based on user queries
- Extracts features from raw posture data
- Executes models to generate detailed analyses
- Creates solution traces explaining the analytical process

### 3. Distillation Trio Generator

Components that generate the trio of:
- Query: User question about posture
- Solution Method: Detailed mathematical analysis process
- Answer: Human-friendly interpretation from commercial LLM

## Production Features

This implementation includes several production-ready features:

### 1. Error Handling

- Custom exception types (`ModelLoadError`, `AnalysisError`)
- Comprehensive try/except blocks
- Graceful degradation when models fail
- Input validation at multiple levels

### 2. Logging

- Structured logging with timestamps and severity levels
- Log rotation and file output
- Detailed error logging with tracebacks
- Performance monitoring logs

### 3. Testing & Validation

- Input validation for all functions
- Confidence scoring for all analyses
- Fallback strategies when optimal data is unavailable

### 4. Configuration

- Command-line arguments for example script
- Environment variable support
- Default configuration with override options

## Usage

See `example_usage.py` for detailed usage examples. Basic workflow:

```python
# Initialize solver with model registry path
solver = PostureAnalysisSolver("models/posture")

# Process a query with posture data
result = solver.solve(query, posture_data)

# Generate a distillation trio
trio = create_distillation_trio(solver, query, posture_data, llm_client)
```

### Command-line Usage

The example script supports command-line arguments:

```
python example_usage.py --model-path=models/posture --mode=all --log-level=INFO
```

Options:
- `--model-path`: Path to model registry directory
- `--mode`: Which examples to run (`basic`, `trio`, `dataset`, or `all`)
- `--log-level`: Set logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`)

## Knowledge Distillation Process

1. Generate diverse queries about posture analysis
2. For each query, use the solver to analyze posture data
3. Send solver results to commercial LLM for interpretation
4. Collect query-solution-explanation trios
5. Use these trios to train a specialized domain-expert LLM

## Benefits

This approach has several advantages:

1. **Precision**: Mathematical accuracy from specialized models
2. **Explainability**: Detailed solution traces showing analytical steps
3. **Domain Knowledge**: Incorporates biomechanical principles
4. **Richer Training Data**: Trios provide more context than simple pairs
5. **Specialized Capabilities**: Resulting LLM can discuss complex posture topics

## Production Deployment Considerations

For production deployment, consider the following:

1. **Scaling**:
   - Containerize the solver using Docker
   - Implement API endpoints for solver and trio generation
   - Use queue systems for batch processing

2. **Security**:
   - Sanitize all inputs from external sources
   - Implement API authentication
   - Add rate limiting for API access

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Track model performance over time
   - Monitor confidence scores for drift
   - Implement alerts for model failures

4. **Data Storage**:
   - Store posture data in a secure database
   - Implement data retention policies
   - Version control model files

## Implementation Notes

The current implementation includes:
- Base models for spine and shoulder analysis
- Core solver infrastructure with error handling
- Comprehensive logging system
- Trio generation utilities
- Example usage code with command-line interface

For production enhancement, consider:
- Adding more specialized posture models
- Improving feature extraction
- Implementing more robust commercial LLM integration
- Creating a larger, more diverse query set
