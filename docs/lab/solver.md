Creating a Domain Expert LLM for Male Sprinters with Numeric Processing
=======================================================================

Your approach using a solver-based knowledge distillation is innovative and well-suited to your specialized domain. Let me outline how to implement this:

1\. Numeric Processing Engine Development
-----------------------------------------

### Data Processing Pipeline


`Raw JSON (200MB) → Feature Engineering → Model Training → Model Registry`

1.  Data Preprocessing:

    -   Parse JSON files into structured datasets
    -   Normalize data formats (times, measurements, conditions)
    -   Handle missing values with domain-appropriate strategies
2.  Model Development:

    -   Train multiple regression/ML models for different prediction tasks:
        -   Wind effect calculator
        -   Temperature compensation model
        -   Altitude adjustment formula
        -   Body metrics impact predictor
    -   Validate models against known performance data
    -   Document model accuracy and limitations
3.  Model Registry:

    -   Create a standardized interface for all models
    -   Document input parameters and output formats
    -   Version control your models

2\. Solver Implementation
-------------------------

The solver serves as the mathematical reasoning engine:

`class SprintPerformanceSolver:
    def __init__(self, model_registry_path):
        # Load all mathematical models
        self.models = load_models(model_registry_path)
    
    def solve(self, query, required_models=None):
        # Parse query to identify required calculation
        calculation_type = identify_calculation_type(query)
        
        # Extract relevant parameters from query
        params = extract_parameters(query)
        
        # Select appropriate model(s)
        if required_models:
            models_to_use = [self.models[m] for m in required_models]
        else:
            models_to_use = [self.models[calculation_type]]
        
        # Execute calculation
        results = self.execute_models(models_to_use, params)
        
        # Generate solution trace (showing work)
        solution_trace = self.generate_solution_trace(models_to_use, params, results)
        
        return {
            "numeric_result": results,
            "solution_method": solution_trace
        }
`

solution generator 
`def create_distillation_trio(query):
    # Get solver results including solution trace
    solver_output = solver.solve(query)
    
    # Ask commercial LLM to generate answer using solution trace
    prompt = f"""
    Question: {query}
    
    Using the following calculation method and result, provide a comprehensive answer:
    
    Method: {solver_output['solution_method']}
    Result: {solver_output['numeric_result']}
    
    Your answer should explain the approach, interpret the results in context of sprint performance,
    and provide any relevant additional information.
    """
    
    llm_answer = commercial_llm.generate(prompt)
    
    return {
        "query": query,
        "solution_method": solver_output['solution_method'],
        "answer": llm_answer,
        "metadata": {
            "models_used": solver_output.get("models_used", []),
            "calculation_type": solver_output.get("calculation_type", ""),
            "confidence": solver_output.get("confidence", 1.0)
        }
    }
`

3\. Enhanced Knowledge Distillation Process
-------------------------------------------

### Creating Query-Solution-Answer Trios

1.  Generate Diverse Queries:

    -   Create questions spanning different aspects of sprint performance
    -   Include questions requiring single and multi-model calculations
    -   Vary complexity and specificity


1.  Metadata Enrichment:

    -   Tag each trio with information about:
        -   Models used in calculation
        -   Calculation complexity
        -   Confidence score
        -   Performance factors addressed (wind, temperature, etc.)

4\. Training Your Domain Expert LLM
-----------------------------------

1.  Prepare Training Data:

    -   Format your query-solution-answer trios into training examples
    -   Include explicit instructions on when and how to use the solver
    -   Create examples that demonstrate proper citation of the solver's methods
2.  Training Strategy:



    `Base LLM (Ollama) → Fine-tuning with general sprint knowledge → Solver-aware training → Domain expert LLM `

3.  Solver Integration During Inference:

    -   When deployed, your LLM should:
        -   Recognize calculation-heavy questions
        -   Generate a "solution request" in a standardized format
        -   Incorporate solution results into its final answer
        -   Explain the calculation process in natural language

`# Example distillation trio creation
questions = [
    "How much would a 10.0s 100m time be affected by a 2m/s headwind?",
    "If an athlete runs 10.2s at sea level, what equivalent time might they achieve at 1500m altitude?",
    "How does lane assignment typically affect 200m times for elite sprinters?"
]

distillation_data = []
for question in questions:
    trio = create_distillation_trio(question)
    distillation_data.append(trio)

# Save distillation data
with open("sprint_distillation_data.jsonl", "w") as f:
    for item in distillation_data:
        f.write(json.dumps(item) + "\n")
